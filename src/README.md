# Time Capsule API

A secure and time-locked digital messaging backend API. This service enables users to create, manage, and retrieve encrypted time capsules‚Äîmessages that can only be unlocked at a specified future date and time using a secret code.

## üß† Project Overview

The **Time Capsule API** is a RESTful backend system built with modern JavaScript technologies. Users can:
- Register and log in via JWT-based authentication.
- Create time-locked capsules containing messages.
- Retrieve capsules after their unlock time using a unique code.
- Update or delete capsules prior to unlocking.
- Automatically expire capsules 30 days after unlock time.

Each capsule is:
- **Secure**: Protected by an unlock code and user authentication.
- **Time-Locked**: Only accessible at or after a defined `unlock_at` time.
- **Ephemeral**: Auto-expired 30 days post-unlock to ensure data cleanliness.

## üí° Real-World Use Cases

This system can be used in various meaningful scenarios:
- **Personal Will Declarations**: Securely schedule a will to be revealed to children on a specific future date.
- **Time-locked Letters**: Send messages to your future self, family, or friends.
- **Confidential Instructions**: Deliver sensitive instructions to be unlocked at a later time.
- **Timed Reminders**: Set future reminders for life events, goals, or tasks.
- **Delayed Content Release**: Authors or creators can schedule content drops for a later date.

## üß™ How to Run Tests
Ensure dependencies are installed and run:

```bash
npm test
```
Tests cover authentication, capsule behavior, pagination, and expiration logic.

## üì¶ Endpoints Overview

```http
POST   /auth/register                      ‚Üí User Registration  
POST   /auth/login                         ‚Üí User Login (returns JWT)  
POST   /capsules                           ‚Üí Create a Capsule  
GET    /capsules                           ‚Üí List User Capsules (with pagination)  
GET    /capsules/:id?code=UNLOCK_CODE     ‚Üí Retrieve a Capsule  
PUT    /capsules/:id?code=UNLOCK_CODE     ‚Üí Update a Capsule  
DELETE /capsules/:id?code=UNLOCK_CODE     ‚Üí Delete a Capsule
```

All capsule-related routes require Authorization: Bearer YOUR_JWT_TOKEN.

## üìù Assumptions & Trade-offs
- Unlock code must be provided in query params; an alternative could be body/header for added security.

- Capsules auto-expire via a simulated background task (cron-like behavior); ideal for cloud functions or queues in production.
